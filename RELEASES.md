Got a lot of the parser and type system implemented, can now do all the kinds of type
I want and do name resolution and compute the order of declarations and stuff. Lots
of random parts still stubbed out.

Error handling still a big ??? as I punted on multiple error handling.

Some spans for types are garbage.

Hopefully usable for abi-cafe in 0.3.0!
